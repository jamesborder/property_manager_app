// Widget tests placeholder.
//
// For this project, the primary test value is in the pure Dart unit tests:
// - test/rules/game_rules_test.dart — Core Monopoly game logic
// - test/models/property_test.dart — Property model computed properties
//
// These tests demonstrate the testing pyramid philosophy: heavy unit tests
// for business logic, which run fast and catch the most important bugs.
//
// Widget and integration tests would be added for critical user flows
// (login, purchase, rent collection) in a production app.

void main() {
  // No widget tests yet — see unit tests in rules/ and models/
}
